# GDD
This Game Design Document is prepared by Sancaralp Elmas, Karya Ercan, help by Uğur Evren Çamalan. This GDD is mostly suitable to use between pitch and development phases. Strongly recommended for you to modify headings as how it suits to your project.
Feel free to use it both for personal and commercial use. No references needed, but we would be pleased if you do so. You may note that future games of Wise Monke Entertainment Studio will be made using this GDD.
